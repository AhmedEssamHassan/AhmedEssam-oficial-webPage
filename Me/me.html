              My career path divided to three parts: <br />
              <span>1<span style=" font-size: smaller;">st</span> part</span>
              starts when i was a student, in that time a worked for
              <span>Lahalebo Restaurant</span> as <span>a cashier</span> and
              step by step i became a
              <span>Head Manager for The Home Delivery Section;</span> after
              that I went to serve in the army.<br />
              <br />
              <span>2<span style=" font-size: smaller;">nd</span> part</span>
              starts after I finished the army serve, and this is the worst part
              of my entire live. I warked as an <span>accountant</span> for
              Egypt Pharma Company For Medical Industries, I Was Responsible for
              The Daily Expenses And I Was Doing a Periodic Inventory of The
              Stores. I was completely miserable in this period of my life so I
              decided to quit. <br> By the way I started learning Programing in this
              section of my live. <br /><br />
              <span>3<span style=" font-size: smaller;">rd</span> part</span>
              starts after leaving my job as an accountant, here i started to
              dive deeper in learning programing, improve my skills and i loved
              this time because i felt that i finally found my <span>ambition</span>.
